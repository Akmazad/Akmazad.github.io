## Why Drug Similarity Matters

Drug discovery is notoriously **expensive, time-consuming, and risky**. Traditional pipelines often take over a decade and billions of dollars to bring a new molecule to market.  

An emerging solution is **drug repositioning**: finding **new therapeutic uses for existing drugs**. This approach bypasses several costly development stages and leverages already-known safety profiles.  

At the heart of repositioning lies a simple but powerful idea:

> **Drugs with similar properties are likely to have similar therapeutic effects.**

But how do we *systematically measure* similarity between drugs?  

This is where **[DrugSimDB](https://unsw-data-analytics.shinyapps.io/DrugRepo/)** comes in.

## Introducing DrugSimDB

**DrugSimDB** is a **comprehensive, integrative drug‚Äìdrug similarity database**, covering over **10,317 small-molecule drugs** (including 2,466 approved drugs) and providing more than **238,000 significant drug‚Äìdrug similarity pairs**.  

Unlike existing resources that rely on *one type of evidence* (e.g., chemical structure or side effects), DrugSimDB integrates **multiple modalities of evidence**:

- **Chemical similarity** (molecular fingerprints, atom-pair Tanimoto scores)  
- **Target protein sequence similarity**  
- **Target functional similarity** (Gene Ontology enrichment + PPI context)  
- **Pathway-based similarity** (shared KEGG pathways and constituent genes)  

By aggregating these diverse signals, DrugSimDB delivers **robust, multi-modal similarity scores** that outperform single-source approaches in predicting repositioning candidates.

## How It Works
### Methodological Overview
![DrugSimDB overview schematic](/images/drugsimdb_overview.png)  
*Figure: Multi-layer integration of drug similarity measures into a unified resource.*

1. **Data collection** ‚Äì integrates DrugBank, KEGG, I2D (protein interactions), EnrichR, RepoDB, and SIDER.  
2. **Computation** ‚Äì calculates drug similarity across multiple modalities in R (parallelized for efficiency).  
3. **Integration** ‚Äì aggregates similarity matrices into a single **multi-evidence drug similarity network**.  
4. **Access** ‚Äì provides a **web interface** and bulk-download options.  

### Interactive Web Server

*Figure: Web server*
The **interactive web app** (built with R Shiny) allows users to:  
- Search a drug and inspect its side-effects (from SIDER) ![Example](/images/drugSimDB_search_pan.png)

- Explore its similarity network ![Network-View Example](/images/drugSimDB_search_NetworkView.png) 

- See the tabular view ![Tabular-View Example](/images/drugSimDB_search_tableView.png).  

- Extract a drug information by just hovering your mouse on the drug node ![Example](/images/drugSimDB_node_hover.png). 

- Retrieve PubMed evidence for drug-pair associations by just clicking/tapping on an edge ![Example](/images/drugSimDB_pubmedSearch.png). 

- Visualize 3D chemical structures ![Example](/images/drugSimDB_visualizedrug3D.png).  

- Browse physiochemical & pharmacological properties ![Example](/images/drugSimDB_physio_pharmaco_table.png).

## What Makes DrugSimDB Novel?

DrugSimDB addresses three critical gaps in existing drug similarity resources:

1. **Coverage**  
   - Over 10,000 small-molecule drugs, covering both **approved** and **experimental** compounds.  ![see coverage](/images/drugSimDB_statistics.png)

2. **Integration**  
   - Combines chemical, target, functional, and pathway evidence, ensuring **better coverage of sparsely annotated drugs**.  

3. **Network-Based Validation**  
   - The resulting similarity network follows a **scale-free topology**, like many biological networks. 
   - Validation against **RepoDB** repositioning gold standards yields a competitive AUC of **0.708**, surpassing single-modality methods.

## Key Results
<!--

*Figure: DrugSimDB similarity network follows a scale-free distribution, with hub drugs highly connected to others.* -->

- **Scale-free topology**: A few hub drugs link the network, enabling powerful diffusion-based repositioning methods.  ![see validation](/images/drugSimDB_scalefree.png)
- **Reduced data sparsity**: Multi-source integration fills gaps where single data types are missing.  ![see validation](/images/drugSimDB_reducedDataSparsity.png)
- **Improved repositioning performance**: Multi-modal scores outperform individual similarity metrics.  ![see validation](/images/drugSimDB_improvedPerformace.png).

## Usage Examples
DrugSimDB is very easy to use. ![see in brief](/images/drugsimdb_webserver.png)
1. **Drug repositioning**  
   - Identify candidate drugs for new indications by querying similarity to known therapeutics.  

2. **Side-effect prediction**  
   - Explore overlapping drug profiles to anticipate adverse events.  

3. **Drug‚Äìdrug interaction (DDI) analysis**  
   - Investigate potential pharmacological conflicts in polypharmacy.  

4. **Network medicine approaches**  
   - Apply graph algorithms (community detection, random walks, diffusion) to uncover hidden drug relationships.

## Future Potentials

DrugSimDB is designed to be **flexible and extendable**. Future updates may include:

- Integration of **omics-driven signatures** (transcriptomic, metabolomic).  
- Incorporation of **secondary/3D target structures**.  
- Deeper annotation with **real-world evidence** (EHRs, adverse-event reports).  
- Network-based AI applications (e.g., graph neural networks for drug repositioning).  

By serving as a **foundational drug similarity knowledgebase**, DrugSimDB can fuel discoveries in:  
### üß¨ Rare Disease Therapeutics
Rare diseases often lack effective treatments because traditional drug discovery pipelines are not economically attractive for small patient populations. DrugSimDB offers a **shortcut** by enabling systematic searches for existing drugs with similar molecular profiles to those used in rare conditions. For example, if an experimental compound shows promise in a rare neurodegenerative disorder, DrugSimDB can help identify already-approved drugs with **overlapping targets, pathways, or functional signatures**. This could accelerate access to therapies for underserved patient groups while reducing development costs.

### üéØ Cancer Precision Medicine
Cancer therapy increasingly relies on precision medicine, where treatments are tailored to the molecular characteristics of a patient‚Äôs tumor. DrugSimDB‚Äôs integration of **target sequence, pathway, and functional similarities** makes it a valuable tool for uncovering **alternative therapeutic options** when resistance develops. For instance, if a cancer drug fails due to acquired resistance, its similarity neighbors in DrugSimDB may reveal **backup candidates** that act on convergent pathways. This could guide oncologists in designing **drug substitution or combination strategies** based on molecular evidence.

### ü•ó Drug‚ÄìNutrient and Drug‚ÄìMicrobiome Interactions
The emerging fields of **nutritional pharmacology** and **microbiome research** highlight how diet and gut bacteria influence drug efficacy and safety. By extending DrugSimDB‚Äôs similarity framework, researchers could explore how drugs with **shared metabolic or functional pathways** might interact with nutrients or microbial metabolites. This opens doors to predicting **nutrient‚Äìdrug interactions** (e.g., supplements that enhance or interfere with drug action) and **drug‚Äìmicrobiome crosstalk** (e.g., antibiotics altering microbiome-driven drug metabolism). Such insights could contribute to more holistic, personalized treatment plans.

### üåê Systems Pharmacology Models
Systems pharmacology seeks to understand drug effects at the **network level**, integrating multi-omics data, signaling pathways, and phenotypic responses. Because DrugSimDB itself is a **scale-free drug similarity network**, it naturally lends itself to **graph-based modeling**. Researchers can overlay gene expression, metabolomic, or clinical data onto DrugSimDB to perform **network diffusion, community detection, and multi-layer modeling**. This would support the development of computational pipelines that simulate how drugs perturb biological systems, guiding both **mechanism-of-action studies** and **rational polypharmacy design**.
